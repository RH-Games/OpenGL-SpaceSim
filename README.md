# OpenGL-SpaceSim

University Project part of Graphics 3D model 
Develop a Space simulator using OpenGL C++

## See main.cpp for code 

Line 89 - Display: Setup the light locations, object locations 

Line 306 - void process Keys: input controls and movement of the ship when a button is pressed 

Line 375 and 389 - Key Up and Down: use a switch case to see which key is being pressed. 

Line 407 - main: main is used to call different functions for the simulation. 

Please be aware that collision doesn't work as I wasn't able to get it to work during the time of the assignment. 
However, I know what the problem is and the equation for collision is set incorrectly I was missing one of the axis values. This means it works in 2D instead of 3D. I noticed the problem during my live demo and explained why to my lecture luckily was still gave me a good mask as I was able to explain why it wasn't working.
